The project focuses on understanding and addressing employee churn through an HR analytics dashboard, segmented into three filters: human resources, research and development, and sales. To gauge employee performance and retention accurately, I employed key performance indicators (KPIs) such as employee count, attrition rate, average age, average salary, and average tenure.

The project workflow included:

Data Acquisition: Fetching relevant data sources.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Preparing data for analysis.
DAX Functions: Implementing Data Analysis Expressions for calculations.
Dashboard Creation: Utilizing visualizations like Area Charts, Donut Charts, and Clustered Column Charts.
Key insights derived from the dashboard analysis include:

Approximately 69% of employees departed due to salaries up to $5000.

Male employees outnumbered female employees.

Notably, employees aged 26-35 exhibited the highest attrition rates. Further investigation into potential factors such as work-life balance, career growth opportunities, and job satisfaction could provide deeper insights. Conducting exit interviews to gather feedback from departing employees could identify specific areas for improvement.

A significant finding was that 38% of departing employees came from a life sciences educational background. This highlights the need to explore factors affecting job satisfaction and career growth within this field. Enhancing support and fostering a positive workplace culture tailored to employees with life sciences backgrounds could potentially mitigate attrition rates.

These insights aim to guide strategic initiatives for improving employee retention and organizational effectiveness based on data-driven analysis.
